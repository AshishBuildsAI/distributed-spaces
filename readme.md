# distributed-spaces

**distributed-spaces** is an extension of the open-source Spaces RAG platform into a distributed multi-agent control and orchestration system. It adds support for agent messaging, coordination, and asynchronous task execution across multiple nodes.

## Features

*Creating a New Distributed Space*

- Easily create remote spaces (folders) to organize your documents.
- Upload documents to spaces for querying and interaction.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:**  
  Enables distributed coordination between AI agents via a custom protocol (DMCP) layered on top of the original Spaces API.

## Getting Started

- Node.js >= 18.x
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run the development server with `npm start`

## Specification Reference

This project implements the [Distributed Multi-Agent Control Protocol (DMCP)](https://github.com/AshishBuildsAI/distributed-mcp), which defines the agent lifecycle, messaging formats, and orchestration logic used within `distributed-spaces`.

For details on the protocol, message schema, and coordination model, refer to the [DMCP Specification](https://github.com/AshishBuildsAI/distributed-mcp).
